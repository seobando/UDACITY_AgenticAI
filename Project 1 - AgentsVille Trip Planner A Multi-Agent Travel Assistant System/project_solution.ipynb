    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

    "        - **CRITICAL THINKING FOR WEATHER:** For each potential activity, explicitly consider its `is_outdoor` nature (or infer it from the description) and compare it against the `weather.condition` and `weather.temperature` for that day. If an outdoor activity is incompatible with the weather (e.g., outdoor tennis in heavy rain/thunderstorm, or a long hike in extreme heat), **you MUST avoid recommending it for that day** unless its description provides an explicit indoor/sheltered backup option.\n",
    "        - ACTING on solving each constraint and preference, ensuring that each day has at least one activity and that activities do not overlap.\n",
    "    - Provide a concise explanation of your reasoning for the itinerary choices, including how you addressed the user's constraints, such as:\n",
    "        - Weather: to evaluate if the recommendation is adequate, specifically checking the `condition` field for adverse weather. **Explicitly state how you ensured that outdoor activities are not scheduled during adverse weather, or if a backup plan made them suitable.**\n",
    "        - Budget: to check that the sum of the total `price` of all selected activities is within the budget threshold. Calculate `total_cost` by summing the `price` of all chosen activities across all days.\n",
    "        - Interests: to delimit the recommended activity to the interests. Match `related_interests` of activities with the user's provided interests, prioritizing activities that align closely.\n",
    "        - Any trade-offs made: Clearly articulate any compromises due to conflicting constraints.\n",
    "    - Clearly state how the \"at least one activity per day\" constraint was met for each day.\n",
    "    - If no suitable activities can be found for a given day based on constraints (including weather compatibility), explain why and recommend filling the `activity_recommendations` array for that day as an empty list `[]`.\n",

    "Your primary task is to revise an existing travel itinerary based on traveler feedback and evaluation outcomes. You must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Feedback and Initial State:** Carefully consider the user's feedback and the initial itinerary.\n",
    "2.  **Evaluate Current Itinerary:** Begin by evaluating the provided itinerary using `run_evals_tool` to identify all areas that need improvement or do not meet constraints (weather, interests, budget, overlaps, minimum activities per day).\n",
    "3.  **Iterative Revision:** Based on the `OBSERVATION` from `run_evals_tool` and any explicit traveler feedback, devise a plan to address all identified issues.\n",
    "    * If an activity is incompatible with weather, explore alternative activities for that day using `get_activities_by_date_tool`, prioritizing indoor/sheltered options or those with backup plans if the original was outdoor.\n",
    "    * If the budget is exceeded, consider cheaper alternatives or fewer activities.\n",
    "    * If interests are not met, look for activities aligning with those interests.\n",
    "    * If there are overlaps or insufficient activities, adjust timings or add new activities.\n",
    "    * Use `calculator_tool` for any necessary numerical computations, especially for budget adjustments.\n",
    "4.  **Validate Revisions:** After making adjustments, you **must run the evaluation tools again** (`run_evals_tool`) on the *revised* itinerary to confirm its validity and to ensure all issues are resolved.\n",
    "5.  **Final Submission:** When you have a final, revised itinerary that meets all criteria and addresses all feedback (confirmed by the latest `run_evals_tool` observation showing `success=True`), you **must** use the `final_answer_tool` to submit it.\n",
